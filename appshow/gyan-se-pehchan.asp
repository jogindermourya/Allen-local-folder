                        for students or for those who aspire to participate in competitive exams such as AIIMS, IAS,
                        UPSC, Bank PO, and General Knowledge based contests such as Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC),
                        Siddhartha Basu Quiz Shows etc.
                        However, one must note that General Knowledge goes beyond competitive exams; it is a method of
                        enhancing knowledge base and building an intellectual personality. So, irrespective of age; a
                        good dose of General Knowledge helps the brain to function in the finest possible manner.
                        And what could be the best way to learn while enjoying the perks of winning some exciting
                        prizes.
                        Keeping this very thought in mind, Allen Career Institute has launched the ‘Gyan Se Pehchan’ app
                        – under its ‘Klipinterest’ flagship. Klipinterest is a unique concept of knowledge sharing from
                        various fields of life; on a single platform. Gyan Se Pehchan, powered by Klipinterest, aims to
                        further improve the learning process in a fun way.
                        The Gyan Se Pehchan app truly reflects Allen’s vision of knowledge sharing in a profound manner
                        which is open to all age-groups.

                                    Every game has 15 questions with multiple choice answers. You get 30-60 seconds to
                                    answer, depending on the difficulty level.

                                    You get reward points & score for every correct answer.

                                    Click on restart for next attempt.

                                    You can play another game (after 5 attempts) on redeeming 50000 points or after 3
                                    hours
                                    There are 3 stages where points get locked (Q5, Q10, Q15), so you get minimum
                                    points.
                                    You have three lifelines to use during the game- Fifty-Fifty, Double Dip, Flip the
                                    Question:

                                    • Fifty-Fifty lifeline eliminates 2 options, thus leaving you with only 2 choices.
                                    • Double Dip lifeline allows you to make two guesses for a question, but requires
                                    you to play out the question, thus forbidding you to walk away or use any further
                                    lifelines
                                    • Flip The Question lifeline replaces the current question with another having same
                                    point value.

                                    Top 10 scores of the week are displayed in TOP SCORES.
                                    If you QUIT at any stage, you will get the points earned till last stage
