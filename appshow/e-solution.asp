                        ALLEN E-Solution App

                        ALLEN Career Institute has been the industry leader in offering quality education for the
                        preparation of coveted exams like IIT –JEE (Main + Advanced), JEE Main, NEET –UG and many other
                        talent exams for more than three decades now.
                        <br><br>
                        The institute aims at providing its students with the best resources that can further help them
                        in achieving their target.
                        <br><br>
                        From excellent classroom coaching to online testing platforms, ALLEN has successfully
                        amalgamated technology with modern education needs. It has been our conscious efforts to observe
                        & analyze student learning behavior so that we may identify the learning issues they encounter
                        while studying.
                        <br><br>
                        While students at ALLEN get perfect solutions to all their doubts, thanks to the efficient
                        working doubt centers; there are times when a particular doubt in a question deters them from
                        trying further.
                        <br><br>
                        This often creates lag and students find it tough to concentrate on the topic effectively.
                        <br><br>
                        For such situations, where they need instant solutions to the doubts and continue with their
                        studies without any hindrance, we have launched the E-Solution App – to help pre-medical
                        students of leader and achiever course with video solutions related to Physics and Chemistry.
                        <br><br>
                        The main idea behind launching this app is to aid students get prompt solutions to their doubts
                        through video solutions. This app is an additional benefit alongside ‘Doubt Counters’ which our
                        pre-medical students can use for doubts in physics and chemistry during their dedicated study
                        hours.
