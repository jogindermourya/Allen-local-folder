				<p>Over the past three decades, ALLEN has consistently churned out excellent results in prestigious competitive exams like IIT-JEE (Main & Advanced) and NEET-UG.
				It is the expertise of ALLEN that the institute today has tuned the number one choice for engineering and medical aspirants all across the country. 
				We take extreme pride  in being a part of various success stories that were written in the ALLEN campus. Our students have outshined not just in academics & competitions but have been the torchbearers of values – they have been truly living the principles, morals, and ethics they learned from ALLEN.	
				Our value-based education, commitment towards holistic development of students and welfare of society has been our strength throughout this journey.				
				</p>

				</p>
				<p>And the stature that ALLEN holds today is truly the fruit of persistent hard work and team effort put in through all these years.
				To understand the glory ALLEN enjoys today, let us first take a walk down the memory lane and revisit the things which strengthened and accelerated ALLEN’s growth. 
				</p>
				<h4>Our First-Step</h4>  
				<p>What started with just eight students has now turned the hub of lacs of students who come here to fulfill their dream of making it big in life. The stepping stone was laid by ALLEN director Shri Rajesh Maheshwari, who was always driven with the passion to teach students in the best way possible.
				</p>
				<p>To help him lead the way, eminent Biology professor, Dr. K.G.Vaishnav also joined hands. Their teamwork started paving the path for future success and the stepping stone for turning ALLEN into the revolutionary Pre-Medical coaching institute of that time.
				ALLEN then happened to be the only institute to provide coaching for Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics under one roof.
				</p>
				<p>Later on, the team was joined by <strong>Er. Brajesh Maheshwari</strong> and ALLEN headed towards incomparable success.</p>

				<h4>Our Achievements & Milestones</h4>
				<p>In the year 1991, ALLEN achieved a huge feat with 12 selections in the Rajasthan PMT. The achievement then led to ALLEN securing the top rank in Rajasthan PMT in 1995.
				</p>
				<p>In 2014, ALLEN Classroom students bagged AIR 1 in both JEE Advanced and AIPMT. Thereafter in 2016, the institute secured AIR 1, 2 and 3 in JEE Advanced and NEET- UG from the classroom.
				ALLEN bagged another phenomenal success and entered Limca Book of Records for being the only institute in the country to have achieved the top 10 all-India positions in the AIIMS exam.
				</p>

				<h4>New Avenues</h4>
				<p>Continuing on the path of providing quality education to students while preparing them for the world of competition, ALLEN has successfully expanded its boundaries. Today, ALLEN not only provides classroom coaching for pre-medical & pre-engineering entrance exams but also caters to talent exams like Olympiads, KVPY, HBCSE, NTSE, and others.</p>
				<p>We have even made a strong presence in the e-learning world with one of the biggest online testing platforms, ALLEN Online Test Series which allows students to self-analyze their preparation.</p>

				<h4>& The Journey Continues….</h4>
				<p>As it is said, success is not a destination it is a journey and ALLEN is consistent on this expedition to spread value-based education!!
