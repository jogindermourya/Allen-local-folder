                    after a few months Dr. K.G.Vaishnava, the eminent professor of Biology also joined him. It was the
                    only institute of its time which provided coaching for all Science subjects i.e. Physics,Chemistry,
                    Biology and Mathematics under one roof. This strong association became the foundation stone of the
                    revolutionary Pre-Medical coaching institute of that time.<br><br>

                    New heights of success were scaled year after year. The Institute achieved remarkable Landmark of 12
                    selections in Rajasthan PMT in the year 1991.<br>

                    Meanwhile, Er. Brajesh Maheshwari, a dynamic person with excellent engineering background joined the
                    team. The consistent and ideal team efforts of faculty members, the vivid educational philosophy of
                    all the HODs and the visionary administration of Shri Rajesh Maheshwari altogether laid the path of
                    glorious success, which led the institute to achieve First Rank in Rajasthan PMT in 1995. Since
                    then, ALLEN is known to create ‘never before’ benchmarks.The past
                    achievements were complemented with remarkable progress when our Classroom Coaching Students bagged
                    the
                    All India First Ranks in both the prestigious examinations of India, JEE Advanced 2014 and AIPMT
                    2014 respectively. In 2016, ALLEN broke it's own stupendous records of previous year results by
                    becoming the first ever Institute of the country to produce <b>All India Ranks 1,2,3 in both JEE
                        Advanced and NEET- UG from classroom.</b><br><br>

                    10015+ members as on date, with trust of more than 12 lac + CCP Students since 1988.The Institute is
