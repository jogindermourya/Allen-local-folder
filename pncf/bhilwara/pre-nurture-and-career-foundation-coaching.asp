									<p>Exposure to various aspects of the world around us helps to dream big. A person can only aspire to the level of her/his awareness and exposure in life. Our life is a cumulative effect of all the decisions taken time to time. Our decisions at every stage are based on what exposure we had till date. We can never dream of something we have never come across. It is important to take note of the areas that increase your level of exposure as these become the much needed arsenal to propel us to the next level of life. Children sometimes only aspire as far as they can see their parents doing. Expose your children to good things and watch them excel.</p>
