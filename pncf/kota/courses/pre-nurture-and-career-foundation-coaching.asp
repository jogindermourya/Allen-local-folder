                        Pre-Nurture and Career Foundation courses have been specially designed with a view to prepare
                        students of class 6th to 10th by building a firm foundation of every concept for SA-I and SA-II
                        conducted by CBSE. Our PNCF courseware gradually transforms a student’s learning from the
                        foundation to the excellent level and ensures a concrete conceptual base which helps the
                        students emerge successful in formal school academics and competitive examinations. The periodic
                        tests at ALLEN are planned in such a manner which evaluates the profundity of students’ learning
                        and the multidimensional analysis reports of the test give a microscopic feedback to student on
                        areas or subjects which need to be worked upon and improved.

                        We work towards utilizing the complete potential of our students. Our experienced faculty team,
                        comprehensive study material, periodic tests and multidimensional analysis ensure the sound
                        academic development of our 6th to 10th class students. Their social, cultural, creative and
                        scientific development is also taken care of via regular workshops, career guidance,
                        motivational & spiritual seminars, national and international academic events etc.
